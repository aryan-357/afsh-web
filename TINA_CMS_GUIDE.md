# TinaCMS User Guide for Air Force School Hindan Website

This guide provides instructions on how to use the integrated TinaCMS to manage content for your website.

## 1. Overview

TinaCMS has been fully integrated into the following core pages:
-   **About Page** (`/about`)
-   **Academics Page** (`/academics`)
-   **Admission Page** (`/admissions`)
-   **Contact Page** (`/contact`)

You can now edit text, images, lists (like faculty members, FAQs, curriculum items), and section headers directly through the visual editor.

## 2. Accessing the Admin Panel

### Production (Live Site)
To access the CMS on your deployed website:
1.  Navigate to your website URL and append `/admin` to the end.
    -   Example: `https://your-site.pages.dev/admin`
2.  Login with your GitHub account (authorized in Tina Cloud).
3.  Click on the "Blue Pencil" icon in the bottom left corner to enter Visual Editing mode.

### Local Development
To run the CMS locally on your machine:
1.  Open your terminal in the project directory.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run tina-dev
    ```
3.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/admin`.

## 3. How to Edit Content

Once in the editor:
1.  **Navigate** to the page you want to edit using the website's navigation menu.
2.  **Click** on any editable element (text, image) to modify it directly.
3.  **Sidebar**: For more complex data (like lists of faculty, FAQs, or SEO settings), use the sidebar on the left.
    -   **Collections**: You can also browse "Pages" in the global navigation menu of the CMS sidebar to find specific content files (e.g., `about.md`, `academics.md`).

### Specific Page Features

*   **About Page:**
    -   Edit "ED's Message" and "Principal's Message" (Photo, Name, Message).
    -   Manage Faculty lists (PGT, TGT, PRT) via the sidebar list fields.
    -   Update Core Values.

*   **Academics Page:**
    -   Update Curriculum items and Academic Calendar.
    -   Manage "Academic Departments" and "Scholars".

*   **Admission Page:**
    -   Update Fee Structure tables.
    -   Manage Admission Process steps.
    -   Edit FAQs and Transfer Certificate requirements.

*   **Contact Page:**
    -   Update Contact Details (Phone, Email, Address).
    -   Change the Google Maps embed URL.

## 4. Saving and Publishing

1.  **Save**: When you make changes, click the **"Save"** button in the top left. This saves a "Draft" to your GitHub repository.
2.  **Publish**: To make changes live, you may need to merge the Pull Request created by TinaCMS (depending on your workflow), or if you are in "Editorial Mode", changes might be committed directly to the main branch.

## 5. Deployment & Configuration

Your project is deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.
-   **Build Command:** `npm run build` (which runs `tinacms build --skip-cloud-checks && vite build`)
-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID`: Your Tina Cloud Client ID.
    -   `TINA_TOKEN`: Your Tina Cloud Read/Write Token.
    -   `GITHUB_BRANCH` or `CF_PAGES_BRANCH`: The branch to use (usually `main`).

## 6. Troubleshooting

### "Content Out of Sync" or "Invalid Version"
If you see errors related to `tina-lock.json` or version mismatches:
1.  This usually happens if the lock file in the repo doesn't match the schema on Tina Cloud.
2.  **Fix:** Trigger a new deployment on Cloudflare. The build script is configured to regenerate the necessary files.

### "Project Not Found" (404)
-   Ensure your Environment Variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID` and `TINA_TOKEN`) are correctly set in Cloudflare Pages settings.
